 UPPER VOLTA
 In its 20 years of independence, Upper Volta completed a
 full circle from democratic rule to authoritarian rule
 and back to democracy. In November 1980, it returned
 once again to authoritarian rule. Throughout this period,
 Upper Volta's 50 plus ethnic groups of varied religions
 have experienced governments that have been notably free of
 repression. In mid-1980, the Third Republic marked its
 second year of democratic multiparty government following
 the transition from military control in May 1978. Democracy
 ended on November 25, 1980 when the Military Committee for
 Reform and National Progress seized power in a bloodless
 coup. The December 1977 constitution was abolished, the
 government dismissed, political parties banned and the
 National Assembly dissolved. In announcing the coup, the
 new military government guaranteed freedom of the press,
 labor unions, traditional culture and religious expression
 so long as they did not threaten national security and
 public order.
 Because the coup occurred in late November 1980, this report
 will generally describe conditions under the 1977 constitu-
 tion. Where possible, information about the intentions of
 the new government will be provided.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Under the declaration of personal rights in the 1977 consti-
 tution Paragraph II, torture was proscribed and was not
 practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There has not been such treatment or punishment in Upper
 Volta. Voltan prison conditions are harsh because Upper
 Volta, a poor country, has few resources to allocate to
 the penal system. Prisoners do have an adequate diet and
 are allowed visits by family members. Sentences for criminal
 acts are within bounds of modern penal practice. By and
 large, fair treatment is accorded the accused regardless of
 class, sex, race or religion.
 c. Disappearances
 Abduction, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are
 not practiced.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment was guaran-
 teed by the 1977 constitution and was respected in practice.
 The right of habeas corpus did not exist in Voltan law but
 defendants could be released before trial at the discretion
 of the presiding judge in consultation with the prosecuting
 attorney's office. Prior to the filing of charges, suspects
 could be held a maximum of 120 hours. Preventive detention
 was authorized in cases of serious criminal offenses for
 
 
 297
 
 renewable periods of six months, but in no case could
 exceed the time the individual would spend in prison
 if sentenced for the crime in question. Because of the
 courts' heavy caseloads, defendants sometimes must wait
 two years for their cases to be heard. It is estimated
 that 15 to 20 prisoners remain in preventive detention
 today. There were no political prisoners in Upper Volta
 until the November 25, 1980 coup. Since then, the former
 President and government ministers and other prominent
 officials have been held in custody at a military camp.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial was guaranteed under the
 1977 constitution. The defendant was formally charged in
 the course of his first interrogatory by the examining
 judge. At that time the defendant was advised of his right
 to counsel and to remain silent. The defendant could elect
 to hire a lawyer or request a public defender.
 The judiciary was independent of the executive, the legis-
 lature and the military. All persons convicted of a crime
 had the right to appeal to a higher court. Individuals
 accused of crimes against the state were tried under common
 law provisions. The code of penal procedure had no provi-
 sions for political crimes or political courts; there were
 no security or political courts.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The home was considered inviolable. A search warrant would
 only be issued by the examining judge upon the written
 request of the district attorney's office. Searches could
 not take place after 9:00 p.m. or before 6:00 a.m. Since
 the coup, the military has conducted house-to-house searches
 for weapons reportedly smuggled into the country before the
 coup.
 2. Government Policies Relating to the Fulfillment of Such
 Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care and Education
 Upper Volta is one of the poorest countries in the world,
 with a per-capita income of $159 in 1979. It is an agrarian
 economy with 91 percent of the population living in rural
 areas. Gross national product per capita has grown by an
 average of 0.6 percent per year since 1960. Among the
 factors slowing development are poor soils, a serious lack
 of water, a paucity of natural resources, geographic isola-
 tion, high internal transport costs and low levels of educa-
 tion.
 Although different areas of the country are faced with dif-
 ferent development problems and varying degrees of poverty,
 the vast majority of the population is poor. The poverty of
 the ethnically heterogenous west and southwest is less acute
 than in the densely populated central and northern Mossi
 plateau or in the arid Sahel region of the Fulani herders.
 The Gourmantche people who inhabit the lightly populated
 eastern region are slightly better off than the politically
 important Mossi, who make up nearly half of the national
 population.
 
 
 298
 Although the only national income accounts done this far
 (1968, 1972, 1974) categorize income sources by tradi-
 tional and modern sectors--and not by urban, semi-urban
 or rural location--indications are that income is not
 sharply skewed in favor of a handful of wealthy urbanites.
 While the modern sector enjoys higher income levels than
 the traditional sector, poverty is pervasive throughout
 the country. Government wage scales, which are adhered
 to throughout the modern sector, are equitable. A national
 commission with members from government, business and
 labor, is examining the minimum basic wage in view of
 raising it to keep pace with inflation.
 Literacy in Upper Volta is estimated at five percent of
 the adult population. One child in six attends primary
 school, and 70 percent of urban children are in primary
 schools compared to 9 percent of rural children. Although
 male enrollment outnumbers female five to three, female
 enrollment in primary schools has grown relatively faster
 than male enrollment since 1960.
 Upper Volta has a weak health infrastructure. Health
 professionals and facilities are concentrated in towns.
 Rural dispensaries are understaffed and poorly equipped.
 There are approximately 50,000 Voltans per physician and
 146,000 per health center. A combination of endemic mal-
 nutrition and a high prevalence of infectious diseases
 reduces life expectancy to 42 years and keeps the infant
 mortality rate at approximately 182 per thousand. The
 government is aware of this problem and has appealed to
 the World Health Organization to prepare a 10-year plan
 of action. This plan was recently completed, and the
 government and donor countries are reviewing it at the
 present time.
 Rapid Population growth threatens to undermine efforts to
 increase per capita income, protect the productive capa-
 city of the natural resources and extend the coverage
 of the educational and health care systems. According
 to World Bank figures, between 1970-1978 the population
 grew at a rate of 1.6 percent yearly. Population pres-
 sures are partially mitigated by heavy migration to other
 countries: at least 600-700,000 Voltans are working in
 neighboring Ivory Coast.
 The Third Republic impressively demonstrated its commit-
 ment to development through its agricultural development
 strategy, five-year development plan and budget alloca-
 tions. As part of its emphasis on agriculture, the
 government decentralized rural development administra-
 tion and made the small farmer the central figure in a
 community development strategy. This strategy emphasized
 increased production of food grain, cash crops through
 price incentives, and a reform of the public marketing and
 storage policies.
 Upper Volta's five-year development plan (1977-1981), attaches
 highest priority to the rural sector, followed by health and
 education. In line with the plan's objectives, the Ministry
 of Health is actively working to improve its rural health
 care system to deliver better preventive and curative health
 services. Preparatory work toward educational reform aimed
 
 
 299
 at revising school curriculum and enlarging coverage of
 the system is underway.
 The budget for 1980 (40.1 billion CFA Francs; $191 mil-
 lion) illustrates both the importance attached to agri-
 culture and the rural sector and the limited resources
 available to address rural problems. Health and education
 consume more than 25 percent of the budget, while national
 defense (mostly personnel costs) claims 17 percent. Of
 the remaining resources, rural development receives the
 largest share.
 3. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a.* Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The 1977 constitution guaranteed freedom of speech, press,
 religion and assembly, all of which were respected in
 practice. From 1979, the government daily newspaper occa-
 sionally carried signed commentaries that critically
 assessed the government's own policies. Two independent
 daily newspapers commented freely on domestic and inter-
 national events. Since the coup, they have continued to
 function freely. Labor unions are still free from govern-
 ment control. The right to strike was guaranteed by the
 1977 constitution. During the Third Republic, the unions
 were markedly open and active in criticizing the government
 when they judged important needs were not being met. Their
 frequent seminars and conventions generated ample criticism
 of government policies and received heavy media coverage.
 In 1980, public sector unions often exercised their right to
 strike--without fear of government reprisals.
 Under the Third Republic, with the exception of the Commu-
 nist Party, which was outlawed, any group or organization
 could hold public meetings. This right to assembly was
 respected by the government and was extensively used by
 private associations. The right of free assembly apparently
 has been ended since the coup.
 Upper Volta has no official religion, and people freely
 practice the religion of their choice. There is no link
 between religion and economic or political advantage in
 Upper Volta. The new government has announced its commit-
 ment to religious tolerance.
 Women enjoy the same rights as men under Voltan law and
 are active participants in Voltan economic life. Their
 political role traditionally has been limited. With
 expanding educational opportunities, however, Voltan women
 are slowly assuming a larger role in Voltan society. The
 Ministry of Social Affairs and Condition of Women works to
 promote greater participation by women in the nation's
 economic, social and political life. Under the Third
 Republic, The Federation of Voltan Women, an active and
 influential organization that speaks out on a wide range
 of socio-political questions, was preparing a draft revision
 of the family code, including issues such as property
 rights, polygamy, and marriage age. Once completed, it
 was to be submitted to the National Assembly. Debate
 on this proposal was expected in the National Assembly
 
 
 300
 in early 1981. Its fate under the new government is
 unknown.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 Freedom of movement within Upper Volta is unrestricted
 for all citizens and there are only minimal controls on
 foreign travel or emigration. Upper Volta respects the
 right of voluntary repatriation as guaranteed by Article
 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For
 each of the few refugee cases they receive, Voltan offi-
 cials honor the provisions contained in United Nations
 Refugee Conventions.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Upper Volta under the Third Republic had a freely function-
 ing multiparty democracy. The freedom to participate in the
 political process, guaranteed by the 1977 constitution, was
 put to the test during the legislative and presidential
 election campaigns and balloting in April and May 1978.
 The political parties functioned freely, had access to the
 media and held public meetings. Opposition party statements
 critical of the government were published in the media
 without difficulty.
 As required by the 1977 constitution, the national legisla-
 ture voted in 1979 to reduce the number of legal political
 parties in Upper Volta from five to three--based on the
 ranking of voter support in the 1978 legislative elections.
 In late 1979, one of the defunct parties merged with an
 opposition party, and two other defunct parties joined the
 majority party. Participation in the political process was
 open to all citizens, with the exception of former President
 Maurice Yameogo who had not yet regained the right to run
 for public office and the, right to hold a high position in a
 political party. Yameogo, however, remained in the public
 eye. He exercised considerable influence in the National
 Union for the Defense of Democracy--one of Upper Volta's two
 opposition parties. Political parties were banned immed-
 iately following the coup.
 4. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known requests by international bodies to visit
 or investigate any alleged rights violations. Upper Volta
 has been an active participant in the Organization of
 African Unity project to promulgate an African charter of
 human rights.
