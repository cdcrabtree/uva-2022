VIETNAM
Because the U.S. government has no diplomatic presence in Vietnam, and outside monitoring groups have no access, the State Department is handicapped in preparing its report on human rights. While the Department has overcome this obstacle to prepare a report which seems generally accurate, a number of problems remain.
First, the Vietnam report's methodology is different from those of the other reports on Asia, and this creates the appearance of bias. The State Department discusses issues neglected in other reports, and is far more willing to speak in its own voice despite the relative paucity of information. For example:
•	The Vietnam report discusses the relocation of the population into "New Economic Zones" in "virgin or unproductive rural areas in order to reduce unemployment in urban centers and expand agricultural production." The report expresses concerns about coercion in the resettlement process, and the dismal conditions in the new zones, including lack of basic services. In contrast, the Indonesia report is silent on the subject of "transmigration," about which similar concerns have been raised.
•	In discussing the denial of fair public trials, the Vietnam report states that the "legal system is characterized by arbitrary detention, without charge or other form of legal process, under the guise of reeducation." Elsewhere, the report states that the government uses reeducation camps "to remove from society those persons whom it sees as dissident elements, particularly leaders." These statements contrast with the Department's discussion of arbitrary arrest without trial in two of Vietnam's neighbors, Singapore and Malaysia. In 1987, both countries used preventive detention laws to stifle political opposition. However, the Singapore and Malaysia reports decline to comment on the reasons for the arrests, other than repeatii^ the government's justifications, which were not mentioned in the case of Vietnam.
•	In discussing discrimination, the Vietnam report states that "[gjradual assimilation and co-option appear to be the Government's long-run strategy for most minorities." llie section then describes in detail controls over these populations, including a program to resettle ethnic

Vietnamese into the highlands that "is designed in part to increase government control over minority groups." Given these assertions, one might expect the China report to contain a discussion of Han migration into Tibet. In fact, however, it does not mention this issue. We cite these examples not to suggest that the Vietnam report should
omit discussion of these issues or avoid these strong conclusions. They are important violations which should be reported and condemned. However, if a similar approach is not taken toward countries that have more friendly relations with the United States, the value of the Country Reports as a source of objective information on human rights is diminished.
Another defect in the Vietnam report is its use of highly critical, sweeping statements that are imprecise. For example, the introduction states that "Cham Muslims in the south and the tribesmen of the central highlands are targets of government campaigns to erase their cultural identities." There is no question that both groups have been subjected to terrible repression. Even so, the report's statement is overbroad. Indeed, a more detailed discussion of the treatment of these groups appears elsewhere in the report, where the reader learns of factors that mitigate the introduction's unequivocal statement: that both groups were involved in "the only sizable resistance movement in Vietnam;" that "most mosques remain open"; and that "[hjighland minorities in central Vietnam are subject to repression if suspected of ties with resistance groups."
There is a similar lack of precision in the section addressing political killings. Acknowledging that information on current conditions is scarce, the State Department discusses reports from former reeducation camp prisoners about summary executions for escape attempts and resistance to camp and prison authorities. Unfortunately, there is no indication of when or where these reports were received. The section also indiscriminately discusses killings by resistance groups of members of Vietnamese military units and other officials, without distinguishing between killings that may and may not have violated humanitarian law.
The section on disappearances discusses the imprisonment of thousands following the fall of the Saigon government in 1975, thus incorrectly implying that these detentions were unacknowledged by the goveriunent. Some of the thousands of detentions that took place may have been imacknowledged.

Critique
although we have not seen widespread allegations to this effect. In any case, the report implies that all were disappearances, and this is clearly misleading.
The report notes "some indications of a more tolerant government attitude" in 1987, and discusses some examples of this. Yet the report fails to note a number of positive developments with human rights significance. These include:
•	the reported abolition of road checkpoints and the reduction of intrusions into homes by local officials;
•	the easing of limits on artists and authors;
•	the increased access for members of the fore^ press; and
•	the reported releases of Protestant and Buddhist clerics in September 1987.
