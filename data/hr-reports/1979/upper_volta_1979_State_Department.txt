 UPPER VOLTA
 Upper Volta in mid-1979 marked its first year of freely-
 elected, democratic multi-party government after a transi-
 tion from military rule. The National Assembly, in which
 the opposition controls nearly one-half of the seats,
 operates in accordance with the 1977 French model consti-
 tution providing for a strong, democratically elected
 executive and a parliament. A number of civil and-political
 liberties, including free speech, the right to petition,
 the right to strike and due process of law, guaranteed in
 the 1977 constitution, are fully exercised. Labor unions
 remain an active, unfettered force. Upper Volta continues
 to emphasize the fulfillment of basic human needs, to
 develop programs to bring women and the disadvantaged rural
 majority more actively into economic and political life, and
 to support human rights both at home and abroad.
 1.   Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 Freedom from:
 a. Torture
 Torture is not practiced in Upper Volta.
 n. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
 Punishment
 There is no such treatment or punishment in Upper Volta.
 Voltan prison conditions are harsh by US standards but
 reflect the fact that Upper Volta, which ranks among the
 world's poorest countries, has few resources to allocate
 to the penal system. Prisoners do have an adequate diet
 and are allowed visits by family members. There are no
 political prisoners in Upper Volta.
 c. Arbitrary Arrest or Imprisonment
 Tnere have been no reported incidents of arbitrary arrests
 or imprisonment in recent years. Freedom from arbitrary
 arrest or imprisonment is guaranteed by the 1977 constitu-
 tion and is respected in practice. The right of habeas
 corous as such does not exist in Voltan law.
 Defendants may be released before trial at the discretion of
 the presiding judges in consultation with the prosecuting
 attorney's office. Bail may or may not be required.
 Preventive detention is permitted under Voltan lawz. Each
 period of detention is for a maximum of six months but may
 be renewed at the request of the attorney general. Prevent-
 ive detention is rarely used.
 d. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public hearing and trial is observed.
 The right to trial is guaranteed under the 1977 constitution.
 e. Invasion of the Home
 The home is considered inviolable and search warrants can
 only be obtained under conditions specified by law.

 2. Governmental Policies Relating to the Fulfillment
 of Such Vital Needs as Food, Shelter, Health Care
 and Education:
 Upper Volta's mixed capitalist/socialist economy is over-
 whelmingly agricultural. No reliable estimates are avail-
 able concerning the distribution of wealth. The Voltan tax
 system combines both progressive and regressive elements.
 Those Voltans who operate in the modern sector (less than
 five percent of the population) pay income taxes based on a
 progressive scale. Other Voltans are subject to a fixed
 head tax.
 The right to work, health care, and education are guaranteed
 under the 1977 constitution. Government economic and finan-
 cial policies focus on improving the conditions of the rural
 poor, about 95 percent of Upper Volta's population. Upper
 Volta's third five-year development plan (1977-1981) attaches
 its highest priority to the rural sector, followed by educa-
 tion, economic infrastructure and mineral development.
 Despite a crippling drought, earlier development plans
 resulted in average annual increases of agricultural output
 of 3.2 percent and in industrial output of 7.0 percent from
 1970 to 1977. One of the world's poorest nations, Upper
 Volta actively seeks foreign assistance for economic and
 social development. The government is, with foreign assis-
 tance, pursuing programs designed to meet basic needs for
 food, shelter, health care and education.
 While development programs have been moderately successful
 in the past, progress in social and economic development has
 been limited in the last two years owing largely to unfavor-
 able weather conditions. Serious problems still exist in the
 areas of health and education, because of Upper Volta's
 inadequate financial resources. Although enrollment in
 primary schools has doubled since 1960, as of 1976 only 16
 percent of the school-age children were enrolled in primary
 schools. Access to adequate health care continues to be
 limited, largely due to the severe shortage of trained
 medical personnel and budgetary constraints. Corruption of
 government officials is not a serious problem.
 3.   Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Includ-
 ing:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and
 Assembly
 The 1977 constitution guarantees freedom of speech, press,
 religion and assembly, all of which are respected in prac-
 tice. In 1979 the government daily newspaper began running
 signed commentaries that critically assessed the govern-
 ment's own policies. The independent daily newspaper con-
 tinues to comment freely on domestic and international events
 as it sees fit. The government censors articles criticizing
 the Chief of State and government ministers by name.
 b. Freedom of Movement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel and Emigration
 Freedom of movement within Upper Volta is unrestricted and
 there are no controls on foreign travel or emigration.

 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Upper Volta has a freely functioning multiparty democracy.
 The freedom to participate in the political process, guaran-
 teed by the 1977 constitution, was put to the test--success-
 fully--during the legislative and presidential election
 campaigns and balloting in April and May of 1978. The
 political parties continue to function freely, to have
 access to the media, and to hold public meetings. Opposition
 party statements critical of the government are published in
 the media without difficulty.
 As required by the 1977 constitution which mandated an
 orderly approach to democratic government, the National
 Legislature voted in 1979 to reduce the number of legal
 political parties in Upper Volta from five to three--based on
 voter support in the 1978 legislative election. It is
 anticipated that the three largest parties in the National
 Assembly will absorb the elected members of the two defunct
 small parties.
 Participation in the political process is open to all
 citizens. 1979 saw a public reconciliation between former
 President Maurice Yameogo and President Lamizana; Yameogo
 has received full restoration of his political rights.
 Women enjoy the same rights as men under Voltan law but
 their political contribution has traditionally been of a
 more limited nature. As their educational opportunities
 expand, Voltan women are slowly achieving a larger role in
 Voltan society.
 Labor unions are free from government control and the
 right to strike is guaranteed by the new constitution.
 The unions are markedly open and active in criticizing
 the government when they judge important needs are not
 being met.
 4.   Government Attitude and Record Regarding Inter-
 national and Non-governmental Investigation of
 Alleged Violations of Human Rights:
 The Department of State is not aware of any requests by
 international bodies to visit to investigate human rights
 zonditions in Upper Volta.
