 UPPER VOLTA
 The Military Committee of Reform for Netional Progress
 (CNRPN) took power in a bloodless coup on November 25,
 1980, when conservative elements in Upper Volta claimed
 that the *total democracy" of President Lamizana's third
 republic was slipping into "total anarchy.* The CMRPN
 abolished the 1977 constitution, suspended all political
 parties, dismissed the former government and national
 assembly and arrested a number of the former leaders for
 investigation. Ten months later, the new military govern-
 ment is still sorting out its policies and trying to live
 up to its promises, but appears embarked on a full-scale
 campaign to clean up official corruption and has restored
 much of the individual liberty enjoyed under the previous
 regime. The judiciary is independent, trade unions can
 organize, freedom of the press and expression are guaranteed
 although exercised with caution, and traditional cultures and
 religious freedom are respected, as are most individual
 rights when they are not perceived by the government to
 threaten national security or public order.
 1. Respect for the Integrity of the Person, Including
 reedom froms
 a. -Torture
 Under the declaration of personal rights in the 1977 consti-
 tution, torture was proscribed and was not practiced. It
 still is not practiced.
 b. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment
 There has not been such treatment or punishment in Upper
 Volta. Voltan prison conditions are harsh because Upper
 Volta, a poor country, has few resources to allocate to
 the penal system. Prisoners do have an adequate diet and
 are allowed visits by family members. Sentences for criminal
 acts are within bounds of modern penal practice. By and
 large, fair treatment is accorded the accused regardless of
 class, sex, race or religion.
 a. Disappearances
 Abduction, secret arrests, and clandestine detention are
 not practiced.
 d. Arbitrary Arrest and Imprisonment
 Freedom from arbitrary arrest and imprisonment was guaran-
 teed by the 1977 constitution and is respected in practice.
 The right of habeas corpus does not exist in Voltan law but
 defendants can be released before trial at the discretion
 of the presiding judge in consultation with the prosecuting
 attorney's office. Prior to the filing of charges, suspects
 may be held 72 hours for criminal offenses. The CMRPN says
 it seeks to streamline judical procedures, but because of
 the courts' heavy caseloads, defendants sometimes must wait
 two years for their cases to be heard. President Zerbols May
 I policy speech promised to create new courts to shorten such
 delays. There were no political prisoners in Upper Volta
 until the November 25, 1980 coup. Since then, the former
 
 (297)
 
 
 298
 president and fewer than 20 government ministers and other
 prominent officials have been held in custody at a military
 camp or under house arrest. A few labor leaders were arrested
 for organizing a wildcat strike against a government service
 in the spring of1981.
 e. Denial of Fair Public Trial
 The right to a fair public trial was guaranteed under the
 1977 constitution.
 The judiciary is independent of the executive, the legis-
 lature and the military. All persons convicted of a crime
 have the right to appeal to a higher court. Individuals
 accused of crimes against the state are tried under common
 law provisions. The code of penal procedure has no provi-
 sions for political crimes or political courts; there are
 no security or political courts, although investigatory
 commissions continue inquiries and plan to try former
 government officials.
 f. Invasion of the Home
 The home was considered inviolable under the old constitu-
 tion. A search warrant would only be issued by the examining
 judge upon the written request of the district attorney's
 office. Searches could not take place after 9:00 p.m. or
 before 6:00 a.m. Immediately following the coup, the
 military conducted house-to-house searches for weapons
 reportedly smuggled into the country before the coup. Now
 police commissioners can issue warrants to enter a private
 residence.
 2. Respect for Civil and Political Liberties, Including:
 a. Freedom of Speech, Press, Religion and Assembly
 The now-suspended 1977 constitution guaranteed freedom of
 speech, press, religion and assembly, all of which were
 respected in practice. While most of the basic spirit
 of the old constitution remains untouched, there have been
 some limits on the exercise of these freedoms imposed since
 the CMRPN came to power in November 1980. With regard to
 the press, the official government newspaper no longer
 carries signed commentaries that criticize the government
 itself,.and Ouagadougou's independent newspaper exercises a
 self-censoring policy which has limited the amount of negative
 comment it carries.
 Labor unions are free from government control with regard to
 their basic organizing and representation of workers' rights.
 The CMRPN, however, has limited their right of assembly and
 has pursued a policy which emphasized the need for a "respon-
 sible social contract." In practice, this has meant proper
 detailed procedures must be followed to legitimize strike
 actions and that wildcat strikes were not tolerated.
 However, on November 1, 1981 the right of labor unions to
 strike was suspended by a governmental ordnance which also
 abrogated the laws guaranteeing this right to government
 employees. It remains to be seen how this ordnance will be
 implemented. Unions continue to hold seminars, training
 sessions and annual congresses, which have issued both
 critical and supportive communiques.

 Political parties have been "suspended" since November 1980.
 Previously, the Communist Party was outlawed but all other
 groups operated without hindrance. There is no indication
 when the current ban on political activity may be lifted.
 Professional groups, on the other hand, have not been
 interfered with.
 Upper Volta has no official religion and people freely
 practice the religion of their choice. There is no link
 between religion and economic or political advantage in
 Upper Volta. The new government has announced its commit-
 ment to religious tolerance.
 Women enjoy the same rights as men under Voltan law and
 are active participants in Voltan economic life. Their
 political role traditionally has been limited. With expand-
 ing educational opportunities, however, Voltan women are
 slowly assuming a larger role in Voltan society. The
 ministry of social affairs works to promote greater partici-
 pation by women in the nation's economic, social and poli-
 tical life. Under the third republic, The Federation of
 Voltan Women was preparing a draft revision of the family
 code, including issues such as property rights, polygamy,
 and marriage age. Debate on this proposal was expected in
 the national assembly in early 1981. Its fate under the new
 government is unknown.
 b. Freedom of kovement Within the Country, Foreign
 Travel, Emigration and Repatriation
 There are no restrictions on freedom of movements within
 Upper Volta. Travel outside the country requires an exit
 permit, however, and the CMPRN has reviewed these more
 closely than its predecessor. This has been partly in
 response to mistreatment of Voltan migrants in neighboring
 countries, particularly Ivory Coast, and partly an effort to
 keep more able-bodied producers farming in their own country.
 While emigration is restricted, temporary travel is merely
 delayed by the need for a personal appearance and processing
 time on laissez-passer clearances.
 c. Freedom to Participate in the Political Process
 Upper Volta had a freely functioning multiparty democracy
 under the third republic. When the military resumed control
 in November 1980, political parties were banned. They now
 carry on no overt activites, and the seat of the dissolved
 national assembly houses the ministry of interior. Citizens
 still speak reasonably freely, although self-censorship
 restrains the amount of public and published criticism of the
 government.
 3. Government Attitude and Record Regarding International
 and Non-governmental Investigation of Alleged Violations
 of Human Rights
 There are no known requests by international bodies to visit
 or investigate any alleged rights violations. An Amnesty
 International representative visited Ouagadougou in early
 1981. Upper Volta has been an active participant in the
 Organization of African Unity project to promulgate an
 African charter of human rights.

 4. Economic and Social Circumstances
 Upper Volta is one of the poorest countries in the world,
 with a per capita GNP of $180 and growth rate in the 1960-
 1979 period of 0.3 percent. It is an agrarian economy with
 91 percent of the population living in rural areas. Among
 the factors slowing development are a poor resource and soil
 base, a serious lack of water, a paucity of natural resources,
 geographic isolation, high internal transport costs, low
 educational levels and continuing inflation in the cost of
 imported petroleum products and capital goods.
 Detailed national income accounts are lacking in Upper Volta
 but it does not appear that income is sharply skewed in favor
 of any particular group, though the small urbanized sector
 does enjoy a generally higher standard of living than the
 traditional sector. There are no accurate figures for
 the percentage of the Voltan population living below the
 poverty level. Nonetheless, Upper Volta is representative
 of the group of low-income countries south of the Sahara
 where the figure is nearly 40 percent in the urban areas and
 over 65 percent in the countryside.
 Population grew at 1.6 percent annually between 1970 and
 1979. The total fertility rate in 1979 was 6.5 percent.
 This rate of increase, while not as great as in some deve-
 loping countries, does threaten to undermine development
 activities in Upper Volta because of growing pressures on
 agricultural land, much of which is already being cultivated
 beyond prudent limits, and because of the weak educational
 and health care systems which exist. Population pressures
 are partially mitigated by labor migration to neighboring
 countries, principally the Ivory Coast.
 Malnutrition and infectious diseases have kept life expectancy
 low. It was an average 42.1 years in 1978. Infant mortality
 is estimated to be approximately 182 per thousand. Only 25
 percent of the population has access to safe water--50 percent
 of the urban sector and 23 percent in rural areas. Calorie
 supply available for consumption relative to nutritional
 requirements was 79 percent in 1977, down from 84 percent in
 1970.
 Literacy in Upper Volta is estimated at five percent of the
 adult population. The adjusted primary school enrollment
 ratio is 17 percent--21 percent for males and 12 percent for
 females. Elementary school attendance drops off dramatically
 to nine percent in the rural sector.
